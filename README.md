# How this work?
This repo uses [Gitfiti](https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti) to create the false commits.
The steps are as follows:
1. Download a copy of [gitfiti.py](https://github.com/eatPizza311/gitfiti) (This is the fixed version that can get the correct highest number of commits in 2024/08).
2. Create a new GitHub repository to use (so you can easily remove it later if desired).
3. Open the cmd in the directory of the gitfiti.py and execute the command `python gitfiti.py`.
4. Following the prompted questions, use the name of the repo created in step 2 for `Enter the name of the repository to use by gitfiti:`
5. Move the newly created `gitfiti.sh` to a directory where you want the GitHub repository to be initialized on your computer.
6. Navigate to that directory, run `sh gitfiti.sh`, and wait.
7. You should see the pixel art in the contribution calendar after some time.
